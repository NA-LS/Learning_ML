# Learning_ML
This repository contains the programs that I have written while learning ML.

- Key concepts of ML is a course that I did on Pluralsight and the programs in this folder are the ones that I created while working on the course. 
- Logistic Regression Model is a machine learning model that I worked through as an example with Tristan, when I was learning the different models that are available.
